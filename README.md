### Biological Computing
[ColdFusion: "Nano-Biological Computing â€“ Quantum Computer Alternative!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcHcNyC6O84)
- In February of 2016, a group of researchers figured out how to make a successful Nano-Biological parallel computing system that could rival the quantum computer. Let's take a look!

[ExplainingComputers: "Organic Computing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7REp0Y9edA)
- Organic computers are based on living, biological "wetware". This video reports on organic computing research in areas including DNA storage and massively parallel DNA processing, as well as the potential development of biochips and entire biocomputers.
